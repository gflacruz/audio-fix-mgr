Networking Quick Service Shop

Install Quick Service Shop on ALL computers you will be using on your network. This is because drivers for the program has to be installed in your windows system directory. It is best to keep the default directory to install QSS which is 'servpro'. Once you have installed QSS on all then terminal computers, you can delete the .exe files for the servpro directory. This is a safety feature so someone does not run the wrong program. (DO NOT delete on the server) There are some files the program will look for on it's own directory, so don't delete anything other than the .exe files.

Now you should create a short cut on each computers desktop.
On a blank part of the desktop screen, right click to open the dialog box. Point to New, when a new menu comes up, point to Shortcut and left click it. Click on Browse and when the new box comes up click on the small down arrow to the right of the Look In box. Click on Network Neighborhood. Double click on the server, select the drive where QSS was installed, most likely C: drive, click on servpro director, click on serv.exe. Click on Open, then Next, then Finished. This will now create a shortcut to start Quick Service Shop.

Re-Direct Printers
You can redirect the output to a printer to any printer on your network.
Double click on your My Computer icon, then double click on your Printers folder. Right click on the printer you wish to direct your output to, click on Save as Default. Now anytime you go to print out an Invoice or Claim Check, it will print to that printer.
